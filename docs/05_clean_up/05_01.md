    Don't worry if the resources don't get immediately removed. Sometimes resources take a longer time to delete. Keep monitoring the process to make sure the Resource Group is fully deleted.

5. Disable Microsoft Defender for Servers (Arc), Storage and SQL as leaving this running can incur into added costs on your Azure Subscription.
