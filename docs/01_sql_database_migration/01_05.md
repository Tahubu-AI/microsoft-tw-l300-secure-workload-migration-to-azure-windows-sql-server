# Task 05 - Enable advanced capabilities for modern workloads

## Introduction

With Tailspin's SQL workloads successfully migrated and secured in Azure SQL Managed Instance, the final step is to unlock modern data capabilities that go beyond traditional relational queries. This task focuses on enabling vector support within SQL Server, a feature designed for AI‑driven applications such as semantic search, recommendation systems, and similarity detection. By loading vector data and running similarity queries, Tailspin can modernize its analytics and prepare its systems for next‑generation workloads that integrate machine learning and intelligent search directly into the database.

## Description

In this task, you will:

1. Activate vector support on the migrated SQL Server or Managed Instance.
2. Load vector data into the database, representing embeddings or feature vectors for modern workloads.
3. Run similarity queries to validate that the database can perform AI‑driven operations such as nearest‑neighbor search or semantic matching.

## Success Criteria

- Vector support is successfully enabled on the migrated SQL Server or Managed Instance.
- Vector data is loaded and stored in the database without errors.
- Similarity queries execute correctly, returning expected results that demonstrate modern AI‑driven capabilities.
