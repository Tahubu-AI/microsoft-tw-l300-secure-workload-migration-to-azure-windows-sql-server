1. This accelerator provides a complete enterprise migration platform leveraging Azure OpenAI o3 model, Semantic Kernel Process Framework, Azure Container Apps, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Storage Queue, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. The solution consists of a React-based web application for file upload and validation, coupled with an intelligent multi-agent processing engine that analyzes and transforms Kubernetes configurations through event-driven batch processing pipelines.
The architecture follows enterprise-grade batch processing patterns with loosely coupled components, enabling organizations to migrate from GKE and EKS to Azure Kubernetes Service at scale while maintaining comprehensive audit trails and expert-level analysis quality.
open the readme of the solution available at https://github.com/microsoft/Container-Migration-Solution-Accelerator/blob/main/README.md to review the concept and architecture.

2. **Review the solution architecture:**

3. The solution uses a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration pattern where specialized expert agents collaborate to:

- **Platform Detection**: Automatically identify source platform (other cloud providers platform)
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Technical Architect, Azure Expert, cloud platform Experts, and QA Engineer agents analyze configurations
- **Design Transformation**: Apply Azure Well-Architected Framework principles
- **YAML Conversion**: Expert YAML transformation with security, networking, and storage optimizations
- **Documentation Generation**: Comprehensive migration reports with expert insights

4. **Features:**

This solution enables enterprise-grade Kubernetes migration with the following capabilities:

   - **Enterprise Batch Processing Architecture** <br/>
   Complete solution including React web application for file upload, validation, and queue management coupled with intelligent multi-agent processing engine

   - **Intelligent Platform Detection** <br/>
   Automatically identifies source Kubernetes platform (GKE/EKS) through configuration analysis and applies platform-specific migration strategies

   - **Multi-Agent Expert Orchestration** <br/>
   Specialized agents (Technical Architect, Azure Expert, Platform Experts, QA Engineer) collaborate through Semantic Kernel GroupChat orchestration patterns

   - **Process Framework Integration** <br/>
   Each migration step (analysis, design, conversion, documentation) is built using Semantic Kernel Process Framework with event routing and step orchestration

   - **MCP Server Tool Integration** <br/>
   Agents access intelligent tools through Model Context Protocol servers for file operations, knowledge search, and specialized functions without direct model training

   - **Azure Well-Architected Framework Compliance** <br/>
   Configurations transformed according to Azure security, reliability, performance, cost optimization, and operational excellence principles

   - **Comprehensive Migration Reporting** <br/>
   Detailed reports capturing expert analysis, transformation decisions, and recommendations from multiple specialized agents

5. **Agentic Architecture**
