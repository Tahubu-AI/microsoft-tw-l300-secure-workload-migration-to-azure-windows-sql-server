# Task 01 - Enable Azure Arc on Windows VM

## Introduction

Tailspin Toys has certain Windows servers that must continue running on‑premises to support workloads that cannot be fully migrated to the cloud. At the same time, they want to take advantage of Azure's centralized management, security, and compliance capabilities. By connecting their on‑premises Windows VM to Azure using Azure Arc, Tailspin can extend Azure's governance and monitoring tools to their local environment.

## Description

In this task, you will use the Azure Arc Setup wizard directly on the Windows VM to establish that connection, enabling the server to be managed as if it were a native Azure resource.

The key tasks are as follows:

1. Run the Azure Arc Setup wizard from the Windows VM
2. Verify the Windows server is available in Azure Arc

## Success Criteria

- The Windows VM is successfully Arc‑enabled
- The Windows VM is accessible through Azure Arc in the Azure portal

## Solution

2. On the VM blade, select **Bastion** under **Connect** in the left menu, and on the Bastion blade, enter the following username and password, ensure **Open in a new browser window** is checked, then select **Connect**.

    - **Username**: `demouser`
    - **Password**: `demo!pass123`

5. The **Get Started with Azure Arc** window of the Azure Arc Setup wizard explains the benefits of onboarding your machine to Azure Arc. When ready, proceed by selecting **Next**.

    ![The Next button on the Azure Arc Setup get started window is highlighted.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/azure-arc-setup-get-started.png)

6. The setup wizard automatically checks for the prerequisites necessary to install the Azure Connected Machine agent on your Windows Server machine. Once this process completes and the agent is installed, select **Configure**.

8. Sign-in to Azure by selecting the applicable Azure cloud, selecting **Sign in to Azure** and following the prompts to log in, and selecting **Next** once successfully signed in.

    ![The Sign in to Azure button is highlighted on the Sign in to Azure window. The sign-in success message is highlighted, as is the Next button.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/azure-arc-configuration-sign-in.png)

9. Provide the resource details of where your machine should be managed within Azure, selecting your tenant, subscription, lab resource group, and region, then select **Next**.

    ![On the Resource details window, the Azure Active Directory Tenant, Subscription, Resource Group, and Azure Region are set to the lab instance and the Next button is highlighted.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/azure-arc-configuration-resource-details.png)

10. Check **I attest that I have a license covered by Software Assurance** on the **Claim Software Assurance** window (if it appears), then select **Next**.

    ![On the Claim Software Assurance window, the I attest that I have a license covered by Software Assurance checkbox is checked and the Next button is highlighted.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/azure-arc-configuration-software-assurance.png)

11. Once the configuration completes and your machine is onboarded to Azure Arc, select **Finish**.

    ![On the Connecting your server window, the success message and Finish button are highlighted.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/azure-arc-configuration-connecting.png)

12. To confirm the installation, launch **Server Manager** from the Windows start menu.

    ![Server Manager is highlighted in the Windows start menu.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/windows-start-server-manager.png)

13. In Server Manager, select **Local Server** to view the status of the machine in the Azure Arc Management field. A successfully onboarded machine has a status of **Enabled**.

    ![In Server Manager, Local Server is selected and Azure Arc Management with a status of Enabled is highlighted.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/server-manager-azure-arc-management-enabled.png)

14. To view the **WinServer** machine in Azure Arc, select the **Azure Arc** icon in the system tray, then select **View Machine in Azure**.

    ![The Azure Arc icon in the system tray is highlighted and the View Machine in Azure button is highlighted in the Azure Arc dialog.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/azure-arc-connected-view-machine.png)

15. In the Azure portal, you will be taken to the Azure Arc page for the machine you onboarded.

    ![The WinServer page in Azure Arc is displayed in the Azure portal.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/azure-arc-win-server.png)

16. Select **Extensions** under **Settings**. This is where you can install Extensions on the Azure Arc-enabled virtual machine. For example, the **Custom Script Extension for Windows - Azure Arc** extension can be used to download PowerShell scripts and files from Azure storage and launch a PowerShell script on the machine.
